# Original Prompt

Captured from initial planning session.

---

I need to get more succinctly organized about a project I've been prototyping over the last few weeks. It involves a mobile and web user interface, a backend api, a database, and several features, some of which I haven't figured out quite what to call them.

Let's run through the project step by step, starting with identifying the tech stack, and form a plan for how to organize the project in either a github monorepo, or a collection of repos using git modules on github; I may prefer the latter, since I have a tendency to rapidly make prototypes and then abandon them once I feel they've grown too complicated or that my approach could have been better, making something with "swappable" modules more appealing.

Once the basic tech stack and requirements are identified and listed out, let's list out some feature plans. The tech stack may need to be revised as features are identified.

Documentation produced by this should be minimalistic, but accurate. If possible, use Github's wikis feature. This will require a public repository, but the modules can probably still be private.

Save this prompt in the documentation.
